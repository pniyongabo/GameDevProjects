
Tune everything!- have people who have never played before try it out and see 
how difficult it is and how clear the controls and mechanics are
	Tune 
		Player speed
		Bullet spawn rates
		Boss variables

Add life system! I was thinking just add virus sprites on the "Cell Sprite" object 
in the light blue part and set one of them inactive each time you get hit- 
maybe 3 lives like in a triangle around nucleus?

Add win and lose menu in the scene- I (Jacob) will do this after my class

Finish the 2nd boss mechanics and tuning

SOUND EFFECTS! add cool and weird sound effects for shooting, shrinking, growing, 
macrophage shooting, dendritic shooting (zappy effect?), dendritic bomb shooting
I will help with these when I get out of class I think good sounds will add a lot to the 
game feel

Add simple credits scene with return to menu button
